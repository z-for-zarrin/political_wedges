                <p>This tool allows you to generate a detailed graphic which compares the opinions of two groups of your choice
                    on a social, political or economic issue of your choice, in a format called the 'Polarisation Parallelogram'.</p>
                <h4>Wondering where to start?</h4>
                <p>For some interesting shapes, try the following:</p>
                <ol id='suggestions'>
                    <li>Green Party vs Reform Party leaners on 'For some crimes, the death penalty is the most appropriate sentence' (from 'Law and Order')</li>
                    <i>Can you find an example with a higher polarisation value?</i>
                    <li>High vs Low Income people on 'Governments should redistribute income...' (from 'Finance and Economics')</li>
                    <i>How does the polarisation compare to what you expected? Now try some of the Law and Order questions for High vs Low Income.</i>
                    <li>High vs Low Income on the issue of transgender people being allowed to change their birth certificates (from 'Gender and Sexual Minorities')</li>
                    <i>Why do you think the 'jump' in the middle occurs?</i>
                </ol>
